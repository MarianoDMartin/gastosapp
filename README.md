# Gastos App

## Description

The application is to show some of the most important good practices in web applications development. We created a BE using nodejs, typescript and express, a DB using SQL server and a FE using reactjs, typescript and materialUI.

## How to use the app

- Open a terminal and go to */BE*
- Execute `npm i`
- Execute `npm run start`
- Open a new terminal and go to */FE*
- Execute `npm i`
- Execute `npm run start`

After that steps you will get a new browser tap opened with the register view.

To test the app you have to fill ALL the fields and click on **SIGN UP**

After that you will get a message with a message saying the register is completed and a button to go to the **SIGN IN** view

In the sign in view you can fill the email and password that you used to register and click on **SIGN IN**. If your inputs are right, you will go to another view saying you are inside the app.

## Future improvements

- Add code coverage
- Add FE tests
- Add husky library
